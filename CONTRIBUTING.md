### Find a Bug?

- First, please **ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/tronprotocol/trident/issues). If there is you may write more to describe your problem or Like it.

- If there hasn't been an issue addressing your problem, you may open a new one. Please make sure your issue includes a clear title and description. It will be more helpful if you provide an **executable test case** for us to quickly reproduce the problem.

### Want to Fix a Bug?

- Open a new pull request with your patch.

- Please ensure your PR description clearly describes the problem and solution.

## Features and Changes

### New Feature Adding?

- First please **search to ensure there hasn't been a similar feature adding**. 

- Carefully think about if the idea fits the project. You may suggest the change in the Telegram channel, explain it to others and see if the feedbacks tend to be positive. 

### Asking for/Adding Changes?

- You should always search our GitHub to make sure if there has been a duplicated case.

- We are treating changes carefully for they possibly make difference in how Trident works. You are highly recommended to talk with us about your thinking, it may include: What problem are you solving? Why is what you are suggesting better than what's already there?

### Feature Branches

- `develop` is the development branch. Any PR should be open to this branch. In most cases, this is just a semi-finished product. **DO NOT USE**.
